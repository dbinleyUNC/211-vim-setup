# 211-vim-setup 
Want your vim to be set up just like the one in the comp 211 container?   
To customize vim, you need to edit your vimrc and install plugins. The following shell script will do that for you.  
Just follow the steps below! If run into any issues, feel free to email me at dbinley@live.unc.edu.  
>Please note: This script is meant to run in bash. If you are on Mac/Linux, you should be good to go. If you are on Windows though, you will need to download a Linux distribution. I recommend downloading Ubuntu on the Microsoft store. If you liked using the Windows terminal, you can use it with Ubuntu by opening a new tab on the top and selecting Ubuntu once it's installed.

    chmod u+x vim-setup.sh
